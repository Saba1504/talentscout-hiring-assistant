## Technical Details

### Libraries and Frameworks
- **Streamlit**: Frontend framework for creating interactive web applications
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Requests**: HTTP library for API calls (if needed)

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Streamlit-based chat interface
- **Backend**: Python-based logic and state management
- **State Management**: Streamlit Session State
- **Data Storage**: In-memory (Session-based)

### Key Components
1. **Chat Interface**
   - Real-time message display
   - User input handling
   - Response generation

2. **Information Collection**
   - Structured data gathering
   - Input validation
   - State management

3. **Question Generation**
   - Technology-specific questions
   - Dynamic response generation
   - Fallback mechanisms

## Prompt Design

### Information Gathering Prompts
The chatbot uses carefully crafted prompts to:
1. Maintain a professional tone
2. Guide candidates through the process
3. Collect information systematically
4. Handle edge cases gracefully

### Technical Question Generation
Questions are generated based on:
1. Candidate's declared tech stack
2. Industry best practices
3. Common interview patterns
4. Technology-specific challenges

### Conversation Flow
The chatbot maintains context through:
1. Stage-based progression
2. Clear transition messages
3. Consistent formatting
4. Error handling

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. API Integration Challenges
**Challenge**: Initial attempts to use external APIs (Gemini, DeepSeek) faced authentication and availability issues.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented a local rule-based system
- Created a predefined question database
- Added fallback mechanisms for unknown technologies

### 2. State Management
**Challenge**: Maintaining conversation context and user information across sessions.

**Solution**:
- Utilized Streamlit's session state
- Implemented structured data storage
- Created clear state transition logic

### 3. Question Generation
**Challenge**: Generating relevant and challenging technical questions.

**Solution**:
- Created a comprehensive question database
- Implemented technology-specific question sets
- Added fallback generic questions

### 4. User Experience
**Challenge**: Ensuring smooth and intuitive interaction.

**Solution**:
- Implemented clear prompts and instructions
- Added error handling and recovery
- Created a responsive chat interface
