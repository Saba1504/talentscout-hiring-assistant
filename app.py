Hi everyone, this is a quick demo of my project, the TalentScout AI Hiring Assistant — an AI-powered chatbot built using Streamlit that helps automate the initial screening process in hiring. The chatbot launches with a friendly greeting and starts collecting essential candidate details like name, email, phone number, experience, position, and location. It validates inputs like email and phone to ensure correctness. Once I enter my tech stack — for example, Python or SQL — the chatbot generates 3 to 5 relevant technical questions based on that input. It also includes a fallback mechanism, so if I enter something unclear or irrelevant, it responds politely and guides me back on track. There's basic sentiment analysis as well, so if the chatbot senses negative sentiment, it adjusts its tone to be more empathetic. Additionally, the chatbot supports multilingual input, meaning I can type in another language like Spanish or Hindi, and it will still understand and reply appropriately. This tool makes the early hiring process more interactive, efficient, and intelligent. Thanks for watching!"
